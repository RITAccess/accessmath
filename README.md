### Status
Currently our build supports iOS 4.0 - iOS 6.0. View our current discussion, thoughts, and questions on our [wiki](https://github.com/RITAccess/accessmath/wiki/home).

### Documentation
We're currently maintaining our documentation on Google Drive.

### User Interface 
The current build uses Interface Builder as opposed to Storyboard to determine the UI. The project contains several
original icons that will be kept and integrated.

### Networking
We're currently planning on implementing our backend with [socket.io](http://socket.io/) powered by [node.js](http://nodejs.org)
